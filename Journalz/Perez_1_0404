1.What I have is my hundreds of pictures of a fractal animation,I should compile it into a gif hopefully by the 
end of the week. 
2.Get the gif onto the pi and have it run. Once that's finished I can combind Blu's project with mine. If I have 
more time then i can get another gif.
3.Create a box to put the pi in.
