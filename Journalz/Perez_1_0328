1.I'm working on rendering a fractal animation, so that I can display it on my pi without having animation problems.
2.The whole rendering process is time consuming and holds me back from doing anything else.
3.By the end of the week I was hoping to be absolutely finished with the animation, and also hoping that I can find
a program that will display the animation with little to no lag .
4.Time 
5.For sure I will have the animation.
