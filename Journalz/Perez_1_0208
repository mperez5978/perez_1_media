1.I finally found a program, Hydrogen, that can produce music/beats with the makey-makey.
2.No I was not because the district blocks the website that allows me to download the program that is key to this 
project.
3.I don't really need much other than some sensors or conductive tape , something that will allow the makey-makey
to activate very accurately. Also I would need a program that would run different fractals(or even images) when
the sensor is active. 
4.First thing is to is install Hydrogen,or some sort of producing sound that works on the raspberry pi.
