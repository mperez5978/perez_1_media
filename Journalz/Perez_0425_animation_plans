Animation is fun,yet challenging. The whole "create your own world" motive ,and freedom, make the whole process
much more interesting and fun, also I think its interesting making your own creation come to life. The only thing 
I struggle with now is making my scene and animation to where it looks well-done and defined. Yes, I would because
I beleive that the whole animation process is exciting.
