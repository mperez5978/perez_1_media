1. Raspberry pi is a very useful device, but it lacks a lot of hardware that allows the device to preform certain 
tasks. For example when I got my fractal program to work on the pi the pi took some time to let the pi display the 
images.
2. It can be very difficult to get internet on the pi, I remember spending like 2-3 days trying to access the 
internet, Mr.Davis and Austin eventually helped me on that. The annoying part is that the pi has trouble connecting 
to the internet anyway.
3. Fractal programs are not as popular as you might think they are, I had biggest problem finding a fractal program
that would run on raspbian. Once I found one i was disapointed by the pi's preformence when I tried to run it.
