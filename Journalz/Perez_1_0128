SparkFun Capacitive touch keypad-MPR121; The keypad uses MPR121 and 12 touch sensitive pads to give you a simple 
keypad. I could use this to make an easy drum machine or even a simple game that requires a user to press keys in a
pattern. 
Webcam-USB; a simple USB webcam that can be plugged into a computer or dev board. I can just showcase this product 
or probably make a face recognization application.
