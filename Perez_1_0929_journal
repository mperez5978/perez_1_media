\First you must "convert -list font" which tells you all the fonts that is installed on the computer. Once you have 
this information you might want to only get the font names, to do this you must do the same command
("convert -list font"), but at the end add "|grep Font". Next thing to do is add all of the fonts and add them to
a text file . Once you have this information, you're gonna wanna loop through all the fonts you listed. The command
to loop through all fonts is :

for font in $(cat fonts,txt); do convert -background lightblue - fill blue -font "$font" -pointsize 64 label 
:"Ninja Perez" "$font"_ninja.gif

. To display the pictures that you just created do ;

 for image in $(ls *gif);do display "$image"; done
