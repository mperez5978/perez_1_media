Thats hard to determine for me because I don't really know myself, in a sense. I listen to too many different 
genres of music that its difficult to single me out into one genre, I guess I can put myself in a hip-hop beat, 
with jazz influenced instamentals, but that'd be weird to space me out there. As for words, I guess I can put 
in " determined" and "great" + "guy", because I'm always determiend to get something done and I am a great guy.
