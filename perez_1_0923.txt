-During the whole process of creating images, I was able to understand the way we would create images through
 imagemagick. I have figured out how to make my images even more diverse through pango usage.

-For loops are used to create more diverse images.For example you can set the for loop to change the 
foreground and background colors. 

-We might use sed to replace certain text and create images, then using for loops to to make it even more
diverse.
