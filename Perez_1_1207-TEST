We'd be expected to reproduce the basic command for creating an image in image
magick, the git hub uploading process, or even how to kill programs. Skills would 
be creating something out of nothing like images off of image magick,or creating 
a great number of images at one time. In EarSketch we could show that we understand
the fundamental concept on how to compile a song and export it. And in OpenShot we
could demonstrate our skills on grabbing multiple images, or sounds, and creating a
greater project.
